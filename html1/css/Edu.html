  <h2>Brief Description about the projects:</h2>
  
  <br></br>
  <p><b>Modified Asphalt Using CNT:</b></p>
  <p>In a developing nation like India, construction and improvement of quality roads plays a  prominent role.
   Our aim is to increase the strength properties of a pavement by using  Nanotechnology. 
   Nanotechnologies are a quickly extending territory of research in highway infrastructure.
    Carbon Nano Tubes are basic carbon consisting of curved graphene  layer which consists of single layer of atoms in combined hexagonal structure. 
    Carbon  Nanotubes improve the mechanical properties of concrete. 
  Carbon Nanotube is a very  efficient reinforcing agent due to its extremely high aspect ratio and ultra-high strength. 
  In  this study, a parametric experimental investigation was undertaken to determine optimum  mix dosage of CNT in Concrete and in Asphalt or bitumen.</p>
<br></br>
<p><b>Tic Tac Toe:</b></p>
<p>Tic-Tac-Toe, a two player game, is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game since childhood. 
We can play that game with just a pen and paper. 
Inspired by that game, we decided to create that game on the computer using GUI which Graphical user Interface.
 The game is to be played between two people
One of the players chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
If no one wins, then the game is said to be drawn.
</p>

<br></br>
<p><b>Banking Applications:</b></p>
<p>We have done one project in java that is related to the OOPS concept.
 The title of the project is Bank application. 
 This project is all about banking operations like debit credit etc.
  With this project, we can maintain security for our transactions.  
  To work on this project we used inheritance and abstraction. 
These are the main concepts of object-oriented programming.</p>
